- Above is an example of a bootstrap grid nested within another bootstrap grid. This served as the main box within which every pages unique content was stored. These grids also adjust based on the size of the browser or device used to view the website. 

# Learning Points
- Creating a Navbar in BootStrap, using classes to denote "Active" links.
- Using the bootstrap grid system.
- Creating varying column organizations for different media sizes.
- Nesting grids within grids.
- Creating a secondary stylesheet to further customize existing bootstrap classes.
